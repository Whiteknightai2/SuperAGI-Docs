## Running SuperAGI Jira Tool

1. **Create an Issue:** The SuperAGI JIRA Create Issue tool allows you to create issues in your project. By default, it creates a task with predefined settings. To create a task with different details, modify the relevant fields in the create_issue.py script.

2. **Edit an Issue:** To edit a particular issue, specify the issue ID in your goal. The modifications can be made by changing the relevant fields in the edit_issue.py script.

3. **Search for Issues:** You can simply search for a particular issue in your agent's goals and your agent performs a search based on the JIRA Query Language (JQL) query you define. Modify the JQL query according to your requirements in the search_issues.py script.

4. **Fetch Project Details:** Use the 'Get Projects' feature to retrieve a list of your accessible projects. The get_projects.py script can be modified to adjust the parameters of this operation.
